Coding Assignment – RickAndMorty Integration
Your task is to develop a simple integration connector for the Rick and Morty API using Python.
You are free to utilise any libraries that can enhance the clarity, performance, or overall quality
of your code.
API Documentation:
You can find all necessary documentation for the API here: Rick and Morty API. The API supports
both GraphQL and REST interfaces. You can pick any one you prefer for this task.
Your submission should include two components: client module and sample application. You
can package them all together. What matters is the separation on the code level. The sample
application should demonstrate the use of the client module.
Requirements
Client Module:
1. The module must be designed to support asynchronous operations.
2. Ensure the interface is clean, concise, and intuitive. Imagine that other developers will
have to work with it.
Sample Application:
1. Fetch the complete data for the following objects: a) Character, b) Location, c) Episode.
2. Save the retrieved objects into separate JSON files, adhering to the following structure:
{“id”: <generated uid>”, “RawData”: {..original API
response object..}}.
3. Print out a list of episode names that aired between 2017 and 2021.
Keep your solution simple and straightforward. Avoid over-engineering or adding unnecessary
complexity. Stick closely to the requirements.
Submission
Submit your work by either sharing it through a private GitHub repository or by emailing a zip
file containing the code. If you will be sending a zip, make it password-protected with password
Aa123456.
